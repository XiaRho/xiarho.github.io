This is Ruihao Xia's personal homepage.

A short introduction
======
Ruihao Xia is a PhD student from the East China University of Science and Technology ([ECUST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_China_University_of_Science_and_Technology)) who specializes in the field of computer vision and deep learning.
His research is centered on **Event-based Vision**, **Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation**, and **Semantic Segmentation**. 
Xia received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering also from ECUST, where he got excellent grades and developed a passion for Computer Vision.
